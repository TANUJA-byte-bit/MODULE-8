---

##  Aim
The provided code stub reads two strings from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

##  Algorithm

1.Take the first input from the user and store it in variable a.


2.Take the second input from the user and store it in variable b.


3.Join the two strings a and b together and print the result (a+b).


4.Repeat the string a three times and print the result (a*3).

5. End

##   Program
```
a=str(input())
b=str(input())
print(a+b)
print(a*3)
```
